# CO2-Occupancy
Using different models (LSTM, GRU, CNN, RNN) to see which one gives best accuracy on predicting the occupancy.
Adding Embedded layers to best model to see if it predicts better with or without these layers.
Visualize plot_embedding for encoders.
Visualize Correlation matrix for the features.
Plot Temperature, CO2, Light distributions by hour.
